# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Students were given the server for the twitter clone and were tasked with building upon it by practicing their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as some Node and Express back-end skills.

# Purpose

In its current state, this Single Page App allows a user to submit tweets and get autogenerated user info for each individual tweet.

### Cross-Platform Support
This app was also designed to be responsive to users with different devices. As such, mobile and desktop users will have similar experiences, with some aesthetic differences. Experience the difference by running the server on your desktop and accessing the app on your mobile device!

## Check back soon for new features!
