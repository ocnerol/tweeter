# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Students were given the server for the twitter clone and were tasked with building upon it by practicing their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, as well as some Node and Express back-end skills.

# Purpose

In its current state, this Single Page App allows a user to submit tweets and get autogenerated user info for each individual tweet.

#### Cross-Platform Support
This app was also designed to be responsive to users with different devices.
